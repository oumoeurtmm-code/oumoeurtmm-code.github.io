### 🚀 About Me  
**10+ years** of experience supporting and building IT infrastructure, delivering technical projects, and managing cross‑functional teams in both military and corporate environments. I am now focusing on **cloud engineering**, **cloud security**, **technical project management**, and **FinOps**. My foundation in network & systems deployment, enterprise mobility, and service delivery gives me the operational insight to design secure, scalable environments, automate workflows, and drive continuous process improvement.

### 🔧 What I Do  
- **Technical Support & Infrastructure Operations** — Enterprise technical support, network infrastructure deployment, Linux/Windows/macOS systems management, and mobile device platforms.  
- **Project Management & Cross‑Functional Leadership** — Lead teams and projects in military and corporate settings: scope, schedule, resources, delivery, and change management.  
- **Building & Optimizing Systems** — Design and build infrastructure for remote and global sites, enforce SOPs, perform root cause analysis, and optimize service delivery.  
- **Transitioning into** — Cloud Engineering (cloud‑native infrastructure design), Cloud Security (identity/access, auditing, encryption), FinOps (cost optimization, tagging governance, waste elimination), and Technical Project Leadership (end‑to‑end cloud initiative ownership).

---

### 🧪 Past Projects  
- **Remote Infrastructure Build‑Out** — Built network infrastructure for 18 remote locations; coordinated scope, vendor procurement, installation, and resources — delivered on‑time and on‑budget.  
- **Mobile Platform Migration (BlackBerry → Android)** — Led full migration including requirements gathering, pilot rollout, training, provisioning, and post‑deployment support.  
- **SharePoint Administration & Workflow Automation** — Designed, implemented, and maintained SharePoint sites/workflows; collaborated with stakeholders to define requirements, structure permissions, and align with business objectives.
